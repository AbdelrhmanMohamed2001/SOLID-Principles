# What is the meaning of SOLID Principles ?

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

This principle promotes keeping classes focused and ensuring that they handle only one aspect of functionality.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

It encourages writing code that allows for adding new functionality without altering existing code, usually achieved through inheritance, interfaces, and abstraction.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable/substitutable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-designed and that derived classes can be used seamlessly in place of their base classes.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

It promotes breaking down larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, tailored to the requirements of clients, to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules,  both should depend on abstractions.

This principle encourages abstraction and decoupling by relying on abstractions (like interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
